# Plant Disease Detection App

An on-device, highly performant Flutter application designed to implement local computer vision models for detecting plant species and verifying agricultural crop health.

## Overview

This project isolates a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) pipeline within a minimalist, asynchronous Flutter container. The application eliminates the requirement for persistent local databases (SQLite) and backend endpoints, prioritizing realtime isolated edge inference to calculate the raw tensor confidence mappings of crop photography immediately after capture.

### Key Features
*   **Privacy First Edge AI**: Utilizes `tflite_flutter` alongside native Dart `Isolates` to run continuous image inferences directly on the hardware without leaving the device. %
*   **Real-time Image Capture**: Built-in support for immediate parsing from the native Camera roll or user Gallery via `image_picker`.
*   **High Performance Material 3**: Optimized Flutter frontend implementation stripping out arbitrary state-management and tracking mechanisms.

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Flutter Frontend
Developed using standard structural paradigms. The UI strictly leverages modern Material 3 conventions, keeping the UX extremely straightforward with minimal interaction latency.

*   `DashboardScreen`: Serves as the primary operational terminal to retrieve image data.
*   `ScanResultScreen`: Operates exclusively as a data visualizer. It encapsulates the returned metrics generated by the inference engine and overlays the original captured frame.

### 2. TFLite Inference Engine 
A decoupled execution module encapsulating an **EfficientNetB0** computer vision architecture tailored for mobile ecosystems.

*   **Size**: Optimized via quantization (~4MB package footprint).
*   **Input Specifications**: Preprocesses raw Dart image bytes into strict four-dimensional structural nested arrays (`[1, 224, 224, 3]`), bounding the array lengths and asserting Float32 type conformity natively required by the `Interpreter.run()` mechanism.
*   **Data Labeling**: Computes exact matrix comparisons dynamically assigning the max continuous probability across a dictionary of **47 established biological crop schemas** including `Apple Scab`, `Grape Leaf Blight`, and `Corn Common Rust`.

## Installation & Build Guide

### Prerequisites
*   [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (`>=3.10.4`)
*   Android Studio / Xcode (For standard Emulator/Simulator setups)

### Local Setup
1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AryanKo/DetectPlants.git
    cd DetectPlants
    ```

2.  **Fetch Dependencies**
    Ensure a completely clean setup and pull all standard pub packages.
    ```bash
    flutter clean
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Run Application locally**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    *Note: A physical device or emulator is strictly required relative to the underlying `tflite_flutter` FFI binary links.*

### Production Build (<30MB Compiled Binary)
The `android/app/build.gradle` defines hard size optimizations out-of-the-box using the R8 compilation module. Building the release APK dynamically trims out incompatible ABI architectures, significantly crushing external footprints.

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```
